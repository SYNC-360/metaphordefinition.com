# Hero CTA Button Fix - "Try Our Tools" Visibility

**Date:** October 20, 2024
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Button now highly visible

---

## Problem Identified

The "Try Our Tools" secondary button in the hero section was nearly invisible:
- Used primary-color (purple) text on purple gradient background
- Blended in with the background instead of standing out
- Poor contrast and low click-through appeal
- Did not match the prominence of the primary button

---

## Solution Implemented

Updated the `.btn-secondary` styling with a professional frosted glass design:

### CSS Changes Made

```css
.btn-secondary {
    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);      /* Semi-transparent white */
    color: white;                                     /* Bright white text */
    border: 2px solid white;                          /* Clear white border */
    font-weight: 600;                                 /* Bold text */
}

.btn-secondary:hover {
    background-color: white;                          /* Solid white on hover */
    color: var(--primary-color);                      /* Text changes to blue */
    border-color: white;                              /* Border stays white */
    box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);     /* Enhanced shadow */
}

/* Hero-specific styling for additional polish */
.hero .btn-secondary {
    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
    color: white;
    border: 2px solid white;
    backdrop-filter: blur(10px);                      /* Frosted glass effect */
}

.hero .btn-secondary:hover {
    background-color: white;
    color: var(--primary-color);
    transform: translateY(-2px);                      /* Lift on hover */
    box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);     /* Larger shadow */
}
```
