#### Section 3: "Types of Metaphors"
**Before:** Standard 6 types (Simple, Extended, Implied, Dead, Absolute, Mixed)
**After:** Completely reconceptualized with original 6 categories

**New Categories Created:**

**New Analysis Framework:**
Each example now includes:

- **Metaphorical Architecture** (how the metaphor operates mechanically)
- **Phenomenological analysis** (what the metaphor makes possible)
- **Cultural/historical context** (why this metaphor matters)

**Examples Provided:**
1. "Theatrical Consciousness" (Shakespeare) - Analysis of performance as identity
2. "Hope's Corporeality" (Dickinson) - Analysis of impossible identification
3. "Revitalizing Presence" (casual metaphor) - Analysis of efficiency in common speech
4. "Hierarchical Ascension" (business metaphor) - Analysis of linguistic frameworks shaping thought
